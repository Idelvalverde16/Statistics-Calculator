# Statistics-Calculator
Learning advanced array methods by building a Statistics Calculator.

As I expand my JavaScript skills, I'll want to get comfortable with array manipulation methods, such as map(), reduce(), and filter().

In this statistics calculator project, I gained experience with handling user input, DOM manipulation, and method chaining. I got practice by performing statistical calculations like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
